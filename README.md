# Data-Science-with-Python-
Lecture notes in six chapters 


Theses notes are from the lecture of "Data Science with Python" from marketing chair at the University of Tuebingen. And I am excited to share the notes with the ones who would like to learn Python to become a data analyst. You can think of these notes as introductory material. However, the overall Python packages used in data science are all covered including Numpy, Pandas, Data Viusalisation, and Machine Learning.
